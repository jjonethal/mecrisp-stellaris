Due to difficulties with flash write support on LPC845 there is no compiletoflash mode yet.

Therefore you need to generate precomiled binaries containing your Forth program for flashing at once.

To make the emulator:

./compile

To run the binary in emulator:

./runcore ./thumbulator-lpc845m301 mecrisp-stellaris-lpc845m301.bin

To greate a binary with precompiled Forth sources:

./buildcore ./thumbulator-lpc845m301 mecrisp-stellaris-lpc845m301.bin disassembler-m0.txt mecrisp-stellaris-lpc845m301-with-disassembler.bin

Try it:

./runcore ./thumbulator-lpc845m301 mecrisp-stellaris-lpc845m301-with-disassembler.bin
