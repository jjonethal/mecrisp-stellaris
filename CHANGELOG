24.12.2015, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp-Stellaris 2.2.0 - Christmas release !

  My Christmas present for you:
  Mecrisp-Stellaris RA with Register Allocator is ready for mainstream release
  and should already be quite stable after a few months of testing.

  Now you can choose for your projects if you need the smaller classic core
  or the larger RA which includes much stronger optimisations.

  Both should have exactly the same capabilities and behaviours.

  Some hints for the choice:

  If you touch performance barriers with the classic core,
  if you love experiments and if you are curious,
  try the fresh Mecrisp-Stellaris RA core.

  If you have something that already works well with older releases,
  if your project has high demands on stability,
  if space is what you wish to save,
  use the smaller and rock solid classic Mecrisp-Stellaris.

  Changes relative to Mecrisp-Stellaris 2.1.6:

  - Replaced align, with halign
