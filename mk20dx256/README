asciiart.txt	ASCII art words

delay.txt	Words for using the systick timer in polling mode

fault.txt	Redefines the fault ISR.  This allows unhandled exceptions
		to report the exception number

gpio.txt	Define constants for GPIO

hwflow.txt	Words for implementing RTS/CTS flow control

init.txt	My sample init routine for automatically running words after
		reset

led.txt		Examples of using the on-board LED
		REQUIRES:  gpio.txt, delay.txt, timer.txt

loopback.txt	Miscellanous words used when testing flowcontrol and uart

m4-core.txt	Memory mapping of Cortex-M4 system control space

mcg.txt		Words to control the Multipurpose Clock Generator (MCG)
		After loading execute "fullspeed" to switch to 96MHz

misc.txt	Holding place for uncategorized words

nvic.txt	Words for enabling/disabling IRQ's.  Also word for creating
		a software triggered interrupt.

struct.txt	Words for creating data structures

terminal.txt	Work-in-progress.  Start of ANSI terminal code words

timer.txt	Words for using the systick timer in interrupt mode
		See led.txt for example of how to use (led-pulse)

uart.txt: 	Words for capturing UART errors and displaying info

usb.txt:  	Work-in-porogress.  Beginning of USB support.
	   	       Unusable at the moment.


Files for facilitating loading the Forth system:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
geninit		This shell script generates a file called "s0init.txt"
		from a selection of other files and inline commands.
		This version should be used if hardware flow control
		is being implemented (or at least the RTS part), or
		you want to permanently run with end-of-line delays.
		
geninit-2stage	This shell script generates a file called "s0init.txt" 
		and "s1init.txt".  s0init.txt is the bare minimum to 
		crank up the clock speed and implement SW flowcontrol.
		For S0 to load, you probably need a 50ms pause at the end
		of newlines.  After S0, you can turn on software flow control
		and should be able to load the S1 file at full speed.
		Note: I have had mxied sucess with SW flow control and
		the PL2303 USB-to-serial chip, so I've switched to HW
		flow control.

ss		A Super Sed script, used by geninit, to strip comments and
		extra white space to minimize file size for uploading.
		If you don't have supersed, remove from geninit and just "cat"
		the files.

s0init.txt	Stage 0 initialization file created by geninit 

s1init.txt	Stage 1 initialization file created by geninit
