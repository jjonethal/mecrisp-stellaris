Mecrisp finally got a younger sister and mastered the jump
to the ARM Cortex M instruction set.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware and configuration for KL25Z128, KL46Z256, MK64FN1M0:
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Connect USB cable to SDA-USB-PORT

  Flashing is via mass storage interface -
    the board will appear as Flash Disk, just copy .bin file in.
    Maybe you have to do an OpenSDA firmware update before.

  On startup, this runs with internal FLL at 20.97 MHz.

  If you wish to try Mecrisp-Stellaris without target hardware,
  there is a Cortex M0 instruction set emulator prepared for use with
  Freescale Freedom binary images. Go into kl25z128/thumbulator
  directory, type "make", copy the binary and then type
  "thumbulator mecrisp-stellaris-kl25z128.bin" to run.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware and configuration for XMC1100:
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Connect USB cable for flashing and terminal.

  Flashing is possible with JLinkExe from Segger, which is available for Linux:
  https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html
  "Software and documentation pack", 32 Bit TGZ archive is fine.

  JLink_Linux_V510c_i386# ./JLinkExe -device XMC1100-0064 -if SWD -speed 4000
    erase
    loadfile mecrisp-stellaris-xmc1100.hex
    r
    g

  OpenOCD 0.9 has support for the XMC2GO, but it failed with the firmware version
  of my board. The command line would be something like this:

  openocd -f board/xmc-2go.cfg
  openocd -f board/xmc-2go.cfg -c "program mecrisp-stellaris-xmc1100.hex verify reset exit"

  If you have issues with broken characters in the terminal,
  try changing the UART_FDR_STEP value in terminal.s a bit.

  To circumvent a bug in the XMC2GO serial bridge, the baudrate is set a bit
  off the nominal value. If you connect your own terminal, make sure to change
  it to the correct value.
    See mecrisp-stellaris-source/xmc1100/terminal.s for hints.

  On startup, this runs with internal MCLK = PCKL = 8 MHz clock.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware and configuration for EFM32GG990 and EFM32HG322:
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Connect USB cable to DBG connector for flashing and terminal.

  To get the mass storage flashing interface and USB-serial bridge,
  a firmware update of the on board debugger might be necessary.
  See instructions on MBED:
  https://developer.mbed.org/teams/SiliconLabs/wiki/Silicon-Labs-Firmware

  Flashing is done by copying the binary into the USB drive.

  Unfortunately, flashing this way doesn't not perform a proper mass erase.
  If you cannot get it up and running this way, you need use a proper debugger
  and erase the whole flash properly.

  On startup, this runs with internal HFCLK = HFRCO = 14 MHz clock.

  ( Contributed by Mark Schweizer )

  Connect USB cable to USB port
  Open Teensy Loader Application (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html) on your PC
  Select the "mecrisp-stellaris-mk20dx256.hex" file in the mk20dx256 directory
  Select the "Auto" button (this automatically loads the coad and resets the Teensy when the programming button is pushed)
  Press the button on the Teensy 3.1 board to initite the bootloader
  Connect a serial cable to TX1/RX1 (physical pins #2/#3 (these are also Digital IO 0/1 lines)
  Optionally connect CTS/RTS to physical pins #25/26 (these are also Digital IO 18/18 lines)

Hardware and configuration for nRF51822:
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ( Contributed by John Huberts )

  I have been using the nRFgo Motherboard fitted with a nRF51822 module
  to do the development and testing. Programming is done using nRFStudio
  and the Segger J-LINK LITE that comes with the dev kit.

  I was also able to debug using GDB in the nRF51 Eclipse IDE

  The motherboard has a DB9 for serial port connection but jumpers need to
  be placed between P15 (RXD, TXD) and P9 (P2.0, P2.1). If you don't have a
  serial port on your PC then you will need a USB-serial cable.

  The UART can be configured to use other pins on the SOC by changing these
  lines in in terminal.s:

  .equ RX_PIN_NUMBER, 16
  .equ TX_PIN_NUMBER, 17

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware and configuration for Microbit:
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Flashing can be done by just copying mecrisp-stellaris-microbit.hex
  into the Microbit which comes with a mass storage interface.

  Communication is done over P0.24 TX and P0.25 RX, connected
  to USB-serial-bridge on debugger section.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mecrisp-Stellaris itself is sending LF for line ending,
but recognizes both LF and CR. Invoke Picocom with something like
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0 --imap lfcrlf,crcrlf --omap delbs,crlf

For changing line ending to CR-LF or whatever else you like,
look at the beginning of mecrisp-stellaris-....s.

Assembling is done with the GCC-Arm-Embedded toolchain:
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fetch-Modify-Store operations like +! or bic! are not atomic.

* You can contribute your favourite hardware handling routines
    to be included in upcoming releases !

* Chip specific sources have added English comments and hints included
    for simplify porting to other ARM Cortex-M chips.

* For design ideas, have a look into Mecrisp for MSP430, too !

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Turnkey applications
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you define a word with name "init" - its latest definition is called every
startup ! You you can redefine init if you like to add e.g. additional hardware
setup; don't forget to give your old definition of init a call if you have one.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Porting
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mecrisp-Stellaris can assemble without change for M0, M3 and M4 cores.

M0 cores lack conditional execution "ite eq...", which has to be circumvented
by conditional branches. stmdb psp!, {tos} is missing, which I use to push to
data stack and they have no division in hardware.

There is an assembler switch "m0core" to assemble the core with replacement
code for ARM Cortex-M0 chips. Depending on your flash capabilities, there are
two useful switches:

  "charkommaavailable" which is self-explaining and
  "emulated16bitflashwrites" if your particular Flash controller
                             cannot write data in separate 16-Bit chunks.

Core needs about 14 kb flash at the moment, but reserves 16 kb for upcoming
additions, and needs 1.5 kb RAM for stacks and buffers plus variables for
interrupt handlers plus RAM dictionary space. Bare minimum for ARM to get it
running will be around 16kb/2kb, but to have fun with it and leave space for
real applications, go with at least of 32 kb flash and 4 kb RAM.

Look at the flash specification for your particular chip.

The compiler only depends on 2-aligned 16-Bit flash writes
one time per location, you can remove c, and halign without issues
from the compiler, but 8-Bit flash writes are nice to have
for compatibility with standard code.

For special cases having only 4-aligned 32-bit one-time writes to Flash,
there is a hflash! emulation layer.

Flash erasing is only available for the user, it doesn't need erase cycles
while compiling.

Keep these criteria in mind, pick your favourite chip and add it as your
contribution. It won't be too difficult, start with an UART echo written
in assembly without libraries, and I will be there for your help.

You have to change memory map, hardware initialisation and interrupt vectors,
write key?, key, emit?, emit for a first reaction and flash write access
for final success. There is a common mimimum set of handlers across
ARM Cortex CPUs, which will help you to get it running for the first time.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of bit twiddling necessary for peripherial
modules, as they differ a lot across manufacturers. ARMs seem to only share
core components like CPU, interrupt controler and a very basic systick timer.

I don't have the time to support a lot of different chips with examples.

TI ADCs have a sequencer FIFO buffer, ST ADCs need a DMA channel configured.
TI Flash controller offers 32 bit aligned writes only, but as many as you
wish per location until all bits are zero;
ST-M3 have 16 bit aligned Flash write only,
ST-M4 have 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit Flash writes available,
but only once per location.

I would like to focus on core development, support porting to other chips and
families with adaptions in core, but leave writing initialisation code,
testing and writing Forth examples to "family maintainers" which are deep
into their chip of choice.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Register allocator
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It should look and feel like the classic Mecrisp-Stellaris,
but with a very important difference:

It contains an analytical compiler which keeps track
of the top five stack elements and maps them to registers
whenever possible.

To dive in, you should load the disassembler and see
definitions you have just compiled.
