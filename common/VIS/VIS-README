VIS-README for Mecrisp-Stellaris                               MM-200522-220814

To add the VIS-Extension with support for VOCs, ITEMs and STICK Words to
Mecrisp-Stellaris please take the following into consideration:

1. The VIS-Extension is distributed as a source code file named 

   vis-x.y.z-mecrisp-stellaris.fs

2. This VIS-Extension was written and tested with Mecrisp-Stellaris RA 2.5.3
   on the TI LauchPads Stellaris, Tiva C TM4C1294, MSP432P2401R and also with
   linux-ra.

3. The VIS-Extension needs to be installed on a Mecrisp-Stellaris core without
   any pre-installed extensions.

   Reset Mecrisp-Stellaris with  ERASEFLASH  before loading the VIS-Extension.

   With the e4thcom Terminal the VIS-Extension can be loaded with  #r vis
   and the disassembler can be loaded with  #r see.

4. The VIS-Extension modifies some Mecrisp-Stellaris hooks to link the wordlist
   and context switching support into the Mecrisp-Stellaris core. This is done
   by a word named INIT.

   Mecrisp-Stellaris always executes the last defined INIT on startup or reset.

   So, if you define your own INIT in your code, this INIT must execute the
   last defined INIT to make shure, that all previously defined INITs down 
   to the one of the VIS-Extension are executed. Otherwise the VIS-Extension
   (and maybe other extensions) will fail.

5. You can find further information and a VIS Glossary for Mecrisp-Stellaris
   in the Forth-Magazin Vierte Dimension 1/2020.
