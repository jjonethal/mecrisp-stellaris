.word returnstackanfang  @ 10001000: Stack top address
.word Reset+1            @ 10001004: Reset Vector  +1 for Thumb entry

.word 0xFFFFFFFF  @ 10001008
.word 0xFFFFFFFF  @ 1000100C
.word 0xFFFFFFFF  @ 10001010  @ CLK_VAL1  --> SCU_CLKCR    if Bit 31 is zero.
.word 0x00000008  @ 10001014  @ CLK_VAL2  --> SCU_CGATCLR0 if Bit 31 is zero.


@ Interrupt handlers are strangely remapped into RAM by a fixed "Startup ROM".
@ Actual vector table and interrupt handling are quite different from other chips.
